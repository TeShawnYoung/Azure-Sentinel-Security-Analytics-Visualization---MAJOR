# Azure Sentinel Security Analytics & Visualization

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of **Microsoft Sentinel security analytics, KQL queries, and interactive security workbooks** designed to transform raw security telemetry into actionable visualizations for security monitoring, threat hunting, and investigation.

The project focuses on building practical security monitoring scenarios across endpoint, identity, network, threat intelligence, and Azure resource telemetry.

Each scenario includes the underlying **KQL query**, **Microsoft Sentinel Workbook**, **visual dashboard**, and detailed documentation explaining the analysis and security findings.

### 2. 🚨 Azure Sentinel (SIEM) Identity & Endpoint Authentication Monitoring <a href="https://github.com/TeShawnYoung/Azure-Sentinel-SIEM-Identity-Endpoint-Authentication-Monitoring"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/--555555?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white" height="20"/></a>

**Focus:** A multi-scenario Sentinel workbook project correlating identity and endpoint authentication telemetry to surface credential attacks, account compromise, and brute-force activity in near real time.

**Log Sources:** `SigninLogs`, `DeviceLogonEvents`

**Scenarios Covered:**

* **Entra ID Authentication Failures** — failed sign-in analysis, source IP investigation, geographic patterns, and account-targeting analysis to identify potential credential attacks.
* **Entra ID Authentication Success** — successful sign-in monitoring, geographic source analysis, and user/application context to flag unusual or potentially compromised account activity.
* **VM Authentication Failures** — failed authentication attempts against Azure virtual machines, source IP investigation, and geographic visualization to identify potential brute-force activity.

**Key Capabilities:**

* Cross-scenario identity and endpoint authentication monitoring
* Source IP and geographic authentication pattern analysis
* Account and device targeting analysis
* Correlation between failed and successful authentication activity
* Identification of credential attacks, brute-force attempts, and potentially compromised accounts

## Technical Architecture & Workflow

1. **Ingestion**
   Security telemetry is collected through Microsoft Sentinel and connected data sources such as endpoint, identity, network, threat intelligence, and Azure activity logs.

2. **Data Extraction & Analysis**
   **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** is used to filter, transform, enrich, aggregate, and analyze security telemetry.

3. **Security Enrichment**
   Where applicable, telemetry is enriched with geographic, identity, network, or threat intelligence context to provide additional investigative value.

4. **Visualization**
   KQL results are transformed into interactive **Microsoft Sentinel Workbooks** using maps, tables, charts, and other visualization components.

5. **Investigation**
   Visualizations are designed to help analysts identify anomalies, prioritize suspicious activity, and develop additional investigative queries.
